## The Pipeline Project

The pipeline project was one where I wanted to be able to do the following:

1. Query YouTube / Instagram for specific videos and download the results (video file, post content, meta, etc).
1. Automatically create some cover art.
1. Combine the videos to create a quick trailer.
1. Export the results to my social media.

This then became the components of the pipeline project:

1. [API Scraper](https://github.com/IORoot/wp-plugin__pipeline--api-scraper)
1. [Generative Images](https://github.com/IORoot/wp-plugin__pipeline--generative-images)
1. [The Processor](https://github.com/IORoot/wp-plugin__pipeline--processor)
1. [Exporter](https://github.com/IORoot/wp-plugin__pipeline--exporter)
